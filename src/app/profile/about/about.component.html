              <p>I'm <strong>Gattuoch Kuon</strong> , a committed Computer Science (major) and Pschology (minor) student who enjoy learning new technologies everyday. As a new technologists, I have the drive and the passion to get the most out of programming. I`m passionate about studying people`s behaviour, technology and the development of a better society.</p>
              <p>
              I`m fascinated by Human behaviour, how people make decisions, what motivate them and how they act in different scenarios. "We think of technology: software and hardware, We tend not to think about the human side: the impact of what weâ€™ve created and adopted as it permeates our lives. It impacts our cognition and our social interactions", by Dr Lee.  This is the intersection between Computer Science and Psychology I`m passionate about it.
